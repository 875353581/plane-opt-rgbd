# Supplementary material
This is the supplementary material for the paper:
***
Chao Wang, Xiaohu Guo, *Plane-Based Optimization of Geometry and Texture for RGB-D Reconstruction of Indoor Scenes*, to appear in Proceedings of International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV 2018).
***
The material contains a video file `plane-opt-3dv2018.mp4` and a folder `models` with our result textured models and two original models.

Our result models are the `obj` files in separate folders. You can view these models in MeshLab. Note to turn off the light (light on/off button in the render toolbar) when viewing them in Meshlab. 

We provide two original dense models of sequence `of_kr2` and `lr_kr2` from ICL-NUIM dataset, as `of_kt2_voxelhashing.ply` and `lr_kt2_voxelhashing.ply`. The two models are reconstructed by [VoxelHashing platform](https://github.com/niessner/VoxelHashing) with groundtruth camera poses. The reason to use VoxelHashing instead of BundleFusion platform is that, according to 3DLite paper, "BundleFusionâ€™s online re-integration updates use color discretized to bytes, there may be some small color artifacts in the resulting reconstruction". The original RGB-D sequences for the two models can be found in [ICL-NUIM website](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ahanda/VaFRIC/iclnuim.html).

All the other original dense models as well as original RGB-D sequences can be found in the [BundleFusion website](http://graphics.stanford.edu/projects/bundlefusion/).
